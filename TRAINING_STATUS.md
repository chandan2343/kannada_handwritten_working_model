# Training Status

## 🚀 Training Started

The model training has been initiated with the following parameters:

- **Dataset**: `Data` folder in project root
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Model**: ImprovedKannadaCNN
- **Enhanced Preprocessing**: Enabled
- **Auto Split**: Enabled (20% validation split)

## 📊 Monitoring Training

### Option 1: Check Process Status
```powershell
Get-Process python
```

### Option 2: Check Model Checkpoint
The best model will be saved to:
```
checkpoints/best_improved.pt
```

Check if it exists and when it was last modified:
```powershell
Get-Item checkpoints\best_improved.pt | Select-Object LastWriteTime
```

### Option 3: Run Training in Foreground
To see training progress in real-time, run:
```bash
python train_improved.py --data_dir Data --epochs 50 --batch_size 64 --use_improved_model --enhanced_preprocessing --auto_split --val_split 0.15
```

Or use the batch file:
```bash
train_model.bat
```

## ⏱️ Expected Training Time

Training time depends on:
- Number of images in dataset
- Number of classes
- Hardware (CPU/GPU)
- Batch size

**Estimated time**: 30 minutes to several hours depending on dataset size

## 📝 Training Output

The training script will:
1. Load and analyze the dataset
2. Automatically detect number of classes
3. Create train/val split if needed
4. Train the model epoch by epoch
5. Save the best model to `checkpoints/best_improved.pt`

## ✅ Completion

When training completes, you'll see:
- Final validation accuracy
- Model saved location
- Total training time

## 🔄 After Training

Once training is complete:
1. Restart the Flask app to load the new model
2. Test with your handwritten images
3. The model will automatically use the new classes
